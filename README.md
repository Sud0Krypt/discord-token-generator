# Discord Token Generator 

## NOTE: 

Most configuration options are not actually implemented yet I am rewriting the generator from scratch so these features will be commited to this repo in the near future.

## DESCRIPTION 

As promised I have posted my discord token generator which I plan to update alot (My goal is to keep this project opensource while maintaining and updating it so something like DMDgo). As some of you might know I used to sell a full token generator/verifier and I still have the source of course but I've decided to rewrite the whole generator from scratch so that's why all the verify features are obviously not working yet (planning on adding very very soon).

## FEATURES 

Too lazy to write out all the features

## Threading Support

Proxy HTTP(s) Support
Captcha API Support (fcaptcha, capmonster, 24captcha, capsolver, hcoptcha, 2captcha, anticaptcha)
